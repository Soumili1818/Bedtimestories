        <h2>STORY ONE:The Exchanged Heads</h2>
        <img src="vk.jpg" height="300px" width="500px" alt="image" >
       <P>Once upon a time there lived a washerman named Dhavala. He once spotted a
        very beautiful lady at pond, who happened to be the daughter of another
        washerman. He instantly fell in love with her and asked
        her parents for her hand.
        <br>Madanasundari, got married to him with her parents consent and went with
        Dhavala. Once the brother of Madanasundari, came to Dhavala to invite his sister and
        brother-in-law to their place for festival season.On the way they happened to
        pass by the temple of Durga Devi, the all powerful goddess of power. Her
        brother wanted to pay a visit to the goddess, and went to the temple. But as
        soon as he came near the goddess, he wanted to make a massive sacrifice to the
        goddess and he cut his head off for the goddess. Madanasundari was 
        worried and sent her husband to see the matter. On seeing
        the state of his brother-in-law he
        decided to offer his own head too to the goddess and cut his own head.
        Madanasundari, after a long wait came and saw both her brother and
        husband dead and then decided to take her own life but asked the
        goddesss to get the same brother and husband in the next life. The goddess was
        pleased and stopped her from dying and asked her to join their heads and bodies
        and then she granted them life. In a hurry, Madanasundari, exchanged the
        heads of her brother and husband and was perplexed.
        Betaal stops and asks King Vikram asks this question: Who among the two is the
        husband of Madanasundari?
        Vikram replies with a lot of thought, "The body that carries her husband's head
        is is her husband. The head is the most important part of the human body, and
        the rest of the body is identified by the head."
        As soon as Vikram had finished his answer, Betaal disappeared back to the tree.<br>

        <h2>STORY TWO: The Four Boys Who Made A Lion</h2>
        <img src="v.jpg" height="300px" width="500px" alt="image" >
       <P>Once upon a time there lived four sons of a poor brahmin who taught them all the
        Vedas and the holy scriptures. On their parents death, they decided to go and stay with
        their mother's father. But on reaching there they found that they were unwelcome
        there and that their cousins were unreceptive to the brothers. Then the brothers
        decided to each go out into the world and learn a special skill and come back and meet
        at a common place after a while. So they dispersed and came back to the same place at
        the appointed time. Each told what he had learnt. The first one said, " I can create
        flesh of a creature from a single one of the creature". The second one said, " I know
        how to grow the hair and skin of a creature if it has flesh and bones." The third one
        said, "I can create the limbs of a creature if its form is complete with skin hair and
        flesh and bones". The fourth one said, " I know how to give life to that creature once it
        is complete in form with limbs".
        So they set off into the forest to find a piece of bone on which they could test their
        skills. The first one they found was a lion's. So each of them displayed his skill and
        created a live huge Lion, which as fate would have it, killed all four of them and sped
        away.
        Betaal stops and asks King Vikram asks this question: Who among the four brothers is
        responsible for the death of all of them?
        Vikram replies with a lot of thought, "The fourth one, as he was the one who gave life
        to the otherwise dead structure of bones flesh and limbs and hair"
        As soon as Vikram had finished his answer, Betaal disappeared back to the tree.<br>
