       <P>One afternoon, there was a hungry fox named Tisi which was out for a walk in the jungle. Tisi came across a grape vine where a
        bunch of beautiful grapes were hanging. Its mouth watered at the very sight of the grapes.
        The fox thought to himself that if it could get the bunch of grapes, it would be just
         the thing to quench its thirst and hunger in the sweltering heat of the afternoon.
Tisi then jumped high to reach the bunch of grapes with all his strength. It tried again and again, but the fox missed it
 each time. After several failed attempts, the fox gave up finally and walked away saying that the grapes were too sour.<br>
