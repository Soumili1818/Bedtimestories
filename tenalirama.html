        <h2>STORY ONE:The Golden Mango</h2>
        <img src="t.jpg" height="300px" width="500px" alt="image" >
       <P>Raja Krishna Dev Ray was a great king of Vijayanagara .One day Raja was really worried for his ill mother
            as she had been totally bedridden.
           But there was no response from her.<br>
   One morning, however she called Raja. The very anxious Raja at once hurried
         to her bedroom and touched her feet and whispered " Parnam maa what is troubling so much?"
        Clearing the throat,she said "Son I am at the death's door .
        However I have one last wish .I wish to relish a mango before I leave this earth.
        <br>
        A mango was all his mother wanted. But summer had just began .
        It would be a while for the luscious mangoes to hit the market or even hang from the tress like golden balls.
         The king immediately deployed soldiers to scan through the fields and bring a basket full of best quality
          of available mangoes. The soldiers plunged into action,
          grabbed the mangoes and eventually returned to the royal mansion .
          But alas! Just before the soldiers could place the basket full of mangoes before their king, 
          the Rajmata breathed her last.<br>
        Raja Krishna Deva Raya was distraught. How on the earth would he feel the satisfaction of having appeased 
        his mother's soul?. Raja then consulted Tatacharya,one of his most important advisor. 
        Tatacharya told Raja that" Charity to the needy was very dear to your mother’s heart. 
        Why don't we make golden mangoes and distribute to the poor of our kingdom?" 
        News spread like a wildfire and thousands flocked to collect the golden mangoes given in the memory of 
        the Rajmata. Soon it was not the needy alone but the greedy too.<br>
         Once Tenali Raman got wind of his situation, he actually went to the scene of distribution. 
         Standing outside a kiosk Raman posted himself a strategic point .He was the final authority to pass 
         through for a beneficiary to collect a golden mango.
        
        To the undeserving candidates who presented themselves before him, Raman explained Raja has slightly changed
         the donation process. "Those desirous of golden mangoes should be ready for a blister on their backs!"
          The real needy mustered courage to face the singeing iron rod. This went on until a man complained to Raja 
          "What is it my lord! A golden mango for the palm and the burning rod for the back!.This is a case of
           pinching one cheek of a child and giving a peck on the other!"
        
        The innocent Raja looked very puzzled .Raman's explanation was matter -of -fact."Oh dear king! My mother 
         recently succumbed to a chronic disease .All her life she groaned 'Burn my back with an iron rod, 
         so I don't feel the pain'.
        
        "I am only fulfilling my mother's wish now."
        
        Raja came to his senses and commended gusty Raman for pulling him up cleverly.
         He rewarded him for his golden move.<br>

            <h2>STORY TWO:If You Are Happy </h2>
            <img src="ss.jpg" height="300px" width="500px" alt="image" >
           <P>One day Tenali Rama and his friend were lying on a hammock and enjoying the gentle sea breeze. It was a beautiful day, and both men were smiling to themselves. Seeing his friend, Tenali inquired as to what was causing him to smile. His friend replied saying he was thinking about the day when he will be truly happy.

            “When is that?” Tenali Rama asked. His friend went on to explain that he will truly feel happy when he has a house by the sea, with a comfortable car, a big bank balance, a pretty wife and four sons who would get educated and earn a lot of money.
            
            Interrupting this monologue, Tenali asked, “After all this, what will you do?” To which his friend replies “After all this, I can put my feet up, enjoy the sea breeze and the sun on my face.” Hearing this, Tenali gives out a mighty laugh and says “But aren’t you doing just that now? Minus all the hard work!”<br>
